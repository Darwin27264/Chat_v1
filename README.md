# ISLA_CHATBOT

ISLA is a simple chatbot created in the purpose for me to learn about prorgamming and just as a somewhat personal side project that I am dedicating time to. 

This project started back when I was in Grade 11 (summer of 2020). It contains code that is very elementary and has a very basic rule-based system for conversation making with the user. The program contains a few API calls for real time information such as the weather, time, dictionary explanation of words. 


A detailed devlog can be found via this link. It contains brainstorming ideas, improvements made upon old implementations, personal thoughts, along with progress and challenges during the development.
