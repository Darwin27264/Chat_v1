# ISLA_CHATBOT

ISLA is a simple chatbot created in the purpose for me to learn about prorgamming and just as a somewhat personal side project that I am willing to dedicate time to. 

This project started back when I was in Grade 11 (the summer of 2020).

A detailed devlog can be found via this link. It contains brainstorming ideas, improvements made upon old implementations, personal thoughts, along with progress and challenges during the development.
